# Fully validated registration form

#### The goal of this project is to practice and apply my JavaScript skills by building a registration form with input validation. It checks user-provided information such as email address, date of birth, CPF (Brazilian ID), and requires acceptance of the application terms before submission.

### How to run

```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
